### Illinois: A Violent SocioEconomic Diaspra

Chicago has been dubed America's deadliest city by Axios and Reuters. While its homicide rate is not the highest in the U.S., Chicago has consistently had more total killings than any other U.S. city â€” with 27 people killed in November alone. 

###Why it matters: 
Racial segregation, wealth inequality, gangs and the inability of law enforcement to solve crimes have fueled a crime epidemic. The presense of drugs and violence in areas of all different income levels has only made mattes worse. Minority and impoverished neighborhoods have received the brunt of the impact.

The median income in the majority-African-American neighborhood is $20,000 less than the median income for Chicago, and almost a third of Illinois's poorest neighborhood's residents live below the poverty line. 

The Chicago Police Department recovered 7,000 guns per year that had been illegally owned or associated with a crime between 2013 and 2016, which is three times more than a resident in New York. 

###My Question: 
Are these factors really related? Is the prevelence of drugs in an Illinois county correlated to increased homicide? Do all low income areas have increased drug use or homicide levels? I hope to challege some of these assumptions.
